TODO
1. Prepend http:// if not already there.


IDEAS
1. Add some OOP e.g. the lookup functions, the base32 inc function. Create a class for shortened URLs.

2. Add a hook_install() and .install file to create the urlshort table.

3. Theme the login form same as the URL form. (maybe)

4. Check best practice use of AJAX from a Drupal form.
